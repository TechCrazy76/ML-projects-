📌 **Pre-Processed Data & Sample Trained Model**

To help you run the project quickly, a Google Drive folder also contains:

- `Gudi_model_100_epochs_20000_faces_keras.h5` — sample trained Keras model  
- `sf=1.1_data_images.npy` — preprocessed training images  
- `sf=1.1_data_labels.npy` — one-hot encoded emotion labels  

👉 *[Download Preprocessed Data + Sample Model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GK-uREganN9yG59kESzYwpuCFM64HE1h?usp=sharing)*

These files allow you to **skip preprocessing and training** if you want to run predictions immediately.
