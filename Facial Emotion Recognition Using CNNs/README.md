# Facial Emotion Recognition Using CNNs | Computer Vision |
[Feb 2025 - Apr 2025]

(Self Project)

◦ Trained a CNN in TensorFlow/Keras on the FER-2013 dataset with face alignment and preprocessing
using OpenCV, achieving 66% accuracy with full evaluation via precision recall, F1 and confusion matrix

◦ Deployed a real-time emotion detection system using Haar cascades, enabling live webcam inference across
7 emotions with probability overlays
