# Fake News Detection Using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression | Natural Language Processing |
Mar 2025

(Self project)

◦ Built a fake news classifier using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression with text cleaning, stopword removal
and stemming; achieving 96.5% test accuracy on test set, validated via confusion matrix, precision recall
and F1-score metrics

◦ Benchmarked multiple classifiers - SVM (98.9%) and Random Forest (99.3%), and utilized Scikit-learn
pipeline for modular experimentation, preprocessing, and classification, ensuring robustness and minimal
misclassification
