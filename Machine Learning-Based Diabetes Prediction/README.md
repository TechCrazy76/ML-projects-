[Dec 2024 - Jan 2025]

(Self Project)

◦ Trained Random Forest and XGBoost models on the PIMA dataset with hyperparameter tuning via
RandomizedSearchCV, and preprocessed data using Pandas and NumPy with imputation, feature scaling,
and correlation-based feature selection

◦ Achieved 74% mean accuracy via 10-fold cross-validation, marking a 1.8% improvement over baseline
Random Forest, and attained 0.92 ROC AUC on test data compared to the 0.79 baseline, thereby
significantly improving the classification quality
